RemoteRenderer

This project is designed to substitute the Advanced Ogre Framework (http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/Advanced%20Ogre%20Framework) to provide application streaming functionality. After building and linking all of the external dependencies and supporting libraries in the project, simply replacing the files in a project based on the Advanced Ogre Framework with the corresponding files in the RemoteOgreFramework folder will embed optional game streaming features.

For installation instructions, please consult the INSTALL file in the root directory. For any other questions, help, and support, contact Ryan Griege (rgriege@sbcglobal.net).

# - Try to find the Bullet physics engine
#
#  This module defines the following variables
#
#  BULLET_FOUND - Was bullet found
#  BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS - the Bullet include directories
#  BULLET_LIBRARIES - Link to this, by default it includes
#                     all bullet components (Dynamics,
#                     Collision, LinearMath, & SoftBody)
#
#  This module accepts the following variables
#
#  BULLET_ROOT - Can be set to bullet install path or Windows build path
